Date last modified: 28/10/19

A program used in-conjunction with socialsim. It generates random, realistic social media profiles with events included for posting and following. Outputs a formatted .txt file.

# Usage
``java genfiles <numNames> <numFollows>``

Where numNames is the amount of people you'd like, and numFollows being the number of total people following each other in the network.
